# Simple-C-Compiler
This is a simple C compiler that created with lex and yacc and it is my compiler design course project :) <br>
In archlinux simply install byacc and use it for creating y.tab.c and lex for creating y.lex.c

for installing byacc : <br>
`sudo pacman -S byacc #in ArchLinux usually lex is installed on your system  `
<br>                    `sudo apt-get install byacc lex #in Ubuntu `


# Hint 
just look at compileit.sh

:)
