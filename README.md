# Simple-C-Compiler
This is a simple C compiler that created with `lex` and `yacc` and it is my compiler design course project :) <br>
In archlinux simply install `byacc` and use it for creating `y.tab.c` and `lex` for creating `y.lex.c`.


### Installation
I think that fairly simple packages are needed for this porject. It would be just `byacc` and `bison` and `lex`.

##### For Arch
`sudo pacman -S byacc`

##### For Ubuntu
`sudo apt-get install byacc lex`

`yacc` is the fundamental parts of a compiler. Parsers are integrated in `.yacc` file and there is no optimization for it. However, we have a simple semantic analyzer available to be used here. I try to generate `llvm` assembly in order to use llvm's code optimizer and other benefits of it. 

you can do it by using `assembler.py`. You need to just give three address code which is generated by compiler to python the script as first argument `python2 assmebler.py threeaddresscode.txt`. 

### Hint 
Follow the `mybash.sh` script so that you can figure out how this project is working.
